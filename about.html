		<h1>How do you feel about aging?</h1>
		<p>Do you feel inspired to live your best life with passion and purpose? Or do you feel that you are fighting an uphill battle to just get through the day?
		I hear so many people say that they just want to “feel good” or “feel like themselves again”. When was the last time you felt “like yourself?” Do you know what
		the feeling really means? For me, feeling like myself again took quite a long time, a lot of new approaches and changes in strategy, and a lot of tough 
		self-reflection and self-love. 'Feeling like myself' means being pain-free, energized, adventurous, playful, strong --- just like when I was as a little girl.
		They say youth is wasted on the young, and that was certainly the case for me. After graduating high school, I led an ever-increasingly unhealthy lifestyle well
		into my thirties. But it is never too late to try something new. Around 2010, at 35, it occurred to me that I was probably on the wrong path -- I hit 225 lbs
		on the scale and was feeling terrible every moment of every day. I had constant aches and pains, I was always out of breath, I was disappointed in myself and 
		depressed, I couldn't sleep, etc., etc., etc.</p>
		<p><em>I knew I had to prioritize self-care.</em> I didn't know yet what the best plan was for me, but I started trying things. My first efforts were not ideal and a
		little self-destructive, so didn't really improve my health, even though I did lose weight initially and got outside a lot more. I truly lacked the knowledge
		that I have now. The only thing I did right at that time was throw out the deep fryer. For a couple of years, I went almost exclusively for low-fat products,
		high-intensity exercise, jogging/running, and I consumed ungodly amounts of sugar replacers like aspartame (not to mention the other unhealthy mystery fillers
		they put in refined “low-fat” foods). By 2012, I had probably lost 50 lbs on this lifestyle, but was at a plateau. I was still in pain every day and having
		weird medical issues pop up. I had severe jaw pain (TMJ) for over a month. I felt off-balance. Then, one especially intense exercise week in which I was
		training myself to run long distances, I woke up one morning completely blind in one eye. I always knew running wasn't my thing! This healthcare scare took me
		on a whirl-wind tour (some would call it 'down a rabbit-hole') of research and philosophy in the realm of holistic nutrition and health. I could not, and will
		not, accept that my only Doctor Recommended option to protect my health would be making a pincushion of myself every day for the rest of my life. I took a
		sharp turn in my journey to feel like myself again, and I continue that journey of self-care, self-control, and self-reflection. I have never regretted
		choosing this path. I had my years of ups and downs, but I have never again had another 'weird issue' pop-up with my health.</p>
		<p>In the last 10 years of experimentation with my personal self-care practices, I think I am finally on the right path. I invested in myself and became
		certified as a Registered Holistic Nutritionist a couple of years ago. I am kind to myself and eat according to my personal holistic nutrition principles 
		about 90% of the time. I have a relatively healthy relationship with normal serving sizes and food. Today, I am a whopping 90lbs lighter, and I am feeling
		great as a 'normal/healthy BMI' which I haven't seen since I was a kid. 
		Probably the biggest kick-off to “feeling like my old self again” happened a year ago. I broke off my 30+ year relationship with drinking alcohol. Since
		quitting drinking, I feel closer to my childhood self than ever, genuine, and in line with my core-values. Around the time I stopped drinking alcohol, I also
		started doing some yoga every day - even if all I did for the day was hold a plank pose for a couple minutes, I still did some sort of yoga every day for the
		last year. Yoga helped to ground me spiritually as I transitioned into another path of existence. And I really LOVE doing yoga - the slowness, the mindfulness,
		the amazing health benefits. Yoga experimentation (in all its forms) is now officially a joint passion of mine with Holistic Nutrition - to me Yoga is essential
		to the body's ability to self-correct and achieve a pain-free life. I will be introducing Gentle Somatic Yoga into my holistic practice in 2022. I have recently
		completed the first stage of my training so keep an eye out for more to come on this topic. Over the years, Holistic Nutrition taught me to eat nutritious
		whole foods, eliminate toxins, and find new strategies of exercise and lifestyle that truly matched with what my body needed to meet my goals for feeling like
		my old self again. There will always be competing priorities that will try to get in way of your self-care, but do it anyway. <strong>Start TODAY</strong>, so you can feel
		amazing as you age and live a pain-free and vibrant life far into the future.
